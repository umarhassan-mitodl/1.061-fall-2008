Useful links for the fluid transport devotee.

[E-Fluids](http://www.efluids.com/) — good educational site for fluid dynamics

[Image Gallery](http://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/~cfd/gallery/lim-turb.html) — Laminar/Turbulent Flows — another impressive gallery of flow visualization images, this time from the University of Iowa

[Cushman-Roisin course notes](http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d30345d/courses/engs43.html) — very helpful course notes from Dartmouth professor Benoit Cushman-Roisin's Environmental Transport and Fate class. Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover mass balance, diffusion, dispersion, and air-water exchange among other topics

[Central limit theorem](https://statistical-engineering.com/clt-summary/clt-uniform-distribution/) — animations produced by Charles Annis Statistical Engineering that demonstrate the central limit theorem for various initial particle distributions

[Random walk](http://www.financialwisdomforum.org/gummy-stuff/Random_Walks.htm) — background on the random walk model from QuantNotes

[Brownian motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) — Wikipedia entry for Brownian motion, including its history, the mathematical model that represents it, and a 2D example

[Shear Dispersion Animation](https://ocw-studio.odl.mit.edu/ans7870/1/1.061/f04/tools/index.htm)
