description: Lab assignment on estimating the rate of exchange between a water body
  (the flume) and the overlying air for two volatile compounds, molecular oxygen and
  chloroform. You will use an oxygen electrode to measure the changing concentration
  of oxygen, and gas chromatography (GC) to observe the concentration of chloroform.
